Sometimes you may need to reset or clear the React Native packager's cache. To do so, you can pass the --reset-cache flag to the start script:

Securely Store: Any API keys/secrets should be securely stored either in an encrypted form or in a secure storage provider such as AWS Key Management Service, Google Cloud KMS, Azure Key Vault, etc. Access to these keys/secrets should be strictly limited to only those who absolutely must have them in order to use the API.

Securely Retrieve: When retrieving any sensitive API keys or secrets, it is important to use a secure method such as an authentication system (OAuth, LDAP) to ensure that only authorized users are able to access the keys/secrets. Additionally, all communication should be encrypted using TLS/SSL or similar protocols.

Handle Sensitive API Keys/Secrets: When handling any sensitive API keys or secrets, it is important to always be aware of the security implications of how they are used. This includes never hard-coding API keys in source code or sharing them with others without authorization. Additionally, access to the API should be rate-limited or otherwise restricted in order to prevent overuse. Finally, logs should be kept which document when API keys/secrets were accessed and used for auditing purposes.

Expo provides an easy way for developers to build and deploy React Native apps to app stores. To do this, open the terminal, install the CLI (Command Line Interface) expo-cli package, configure your project directory, and then run the “exp publish” command to make it live on the Expo platform.

3. Create a Google Play Console Account: To be able to publish your app on the Google Play Store, you’ll need to create a Google Play Console account. You can do that by signing up with your Google account credentials.
